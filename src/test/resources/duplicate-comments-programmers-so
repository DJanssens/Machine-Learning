0 The problem is that there *is no* standard way to handle it.There are as many opinions on this as there are programmers.
0 For some of us that computer science class was a long time ago (like 35 years) and we haven&#39;t used terminology like `l_i such that j, P[j]= T [i+j-1] + l_i` since then. Could you, perhaps, rephrase your question in English? You&#39;ll find, when working with programmers and non-programmers, that the ability to discuss your algorithms in English (or other natural language) will help in your own understanding of the problem, as well as theirs.
x Yes, we regularly run into the situation on our development server, we usually have many programmers accessing the same DB for development purposes. So if I add new columns to a table and update a sproc to use them, I make the new parameters all optional, so I don&#39;t break the app for other developers who aren&#39;t running my new code yet. As long as you&#39;re just adding and not deleting or restructuring, that can work fine. It&#39;s when you say, Oh, this field that used to be a column in table A, there now could be many of them so I need to break it out into a new table with a many-to-one ...
x A space is a space. Use `[ ]` (with or without brackets) to match a literal space. The [negation](http://www.regular-expressions.info/charclass.html#negated) `[^ ]` matches characters, that are not literal space :) Hex `\\x20` [ascii](http://www.asciitable.com/) and [utf-8](http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0020/index.htm).
x *Apologies to women programmers for my use of &quot;he&quot;, but it&#39;s still true that most malicious programmers are male. (Someday this will no longer be true; I don&#39;t know if I should welcome it, or fear it.)
x If you don&#39;t get the answer, it is because very few programmers use erlide. The most popular editor is emacs, but you can use any editor like Sublime and just work in command line :)
x I don&#39;t understand down votes. I was just hoping to see others&#39; opinions about &quot;software tools (i.e. Kivy or Pymob) commonly used by programmers&quot;. @slhck
x Welcome to stackoverflow. A little more explanation might help out the fellow programmers to understand how it works.
x There&#39;s no such things as events in core Java - most Java programmers would implement something similar using an Interface callback mechanism
x As someone who is new to C++, I find it a little crazy that the &#39;general&#39; solution (1) requires 3 lines of code and the one to be avoided is a single line of code.  You suggest wrapping the general solution in a helper method and that is great but if this is what we should be using most of the time then why didn&#39;t the authors of the map do this already for us?  It would have saved many thousands of programmers from having to type out their own helper methods right?
x @roryap This is not a suitable question for programmers. Please don&#39;t suggest it as a target.
x Instead provisioning profiles, certificates, command-line tools and workarounds are becoming programmers&#39; main job. You&#39;re not doing it the right way clark...

x @imallett they should share the same semantics as this would result in consistent behavior. Note that C++ would then be easier to learn and use, event for novice programmers, without sacrificing the flexibility it now offers. I would ask: why should the definition (without initialization) of a variable of a primitive, POD and non-POD type share different semantics? I understand that this idea breaks some fundamental aspects of C++ but all this is just theory, for now...
x This is eerily similar to  what used to be a ridiculously common mistake made by COM programmers many moons ago. `if (--m_dwRefCount == 0) delete this; return m_dwRefCount;` I cannot tell you how many times I saw that code crash and burn in *professionally* published components.
x Also related (how it can be fixed from server side): http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26424621/algorithm-negotiation-fail-ssh-in-jenkins
x There is none, but giving c++ resources is something I dislike, and I think many other c programmers too. That site actually has errors.
x Because the system level programmers either were not allowed to use C++ or they did not know C++.  The C++ has some excellent language features that are not OOP that can be used when writing *system level* programs.  One such feature is references.
x The My namespace was added in .NET 2.0/VS2005 to help VB.NET programmers fall in the pit of success.  The difference between the two is not subtle, App.SP asks the operating system about the EXE that got the process started.  That is not yours in plenty of cases, like COM servers, Office add-ins, ClickOnce.
x @Nabi Edit and update your question and tell everyone it&#39;s for a MySQL `WHERE` slice. Then more programmers can help you with another solution. Tell us what you tried like the `eval()` but always tell us what you&#39;re *trying to do*.
x Could you please explain more detailed where to put what. (Stupid question probably.) My IDE likes to create a class `tv` if I put the controller after`@FXML   private TableView&lt;Person&gt; tableView;&#39;
x @sawa What does that even mean? &quot;Ugly hacks&quot; are standard procedure when you&#39;re worried about performance.
x Between you and @DanielRoseman, I am now convinced not to change the names. I&#39;m writing [a tutorial](https://aliteralmind.wordpress.com/2015/02/13/django_auth_tutorial_7/) on how to implement the reset-your-password feature (as a tool to teach myself), and I don&#39;t want to teach something that&#39;s unacceptable to established Django programmers.
x Kritner, per the help center, this is a legitimate SO question (though perhaps not a good one): Stack Overflow is for professional and enthusiast programmers, people who write code because they love it. We feel the best Stack Overflow questions have a bit of source code in them, but if your question generally covers\n\n    a specific programming problem, or\n    a software algorithm, or\n    software tools commonly used by programmers; and is\n    a practical, answerable problem that is unique to software development\n\n then youre in the right place to ask your question!
x @sawa What does that even mean? &quot;Ugly hacks&quot; are standard procedure when you&#39;re worried about performance.
x @DmitryAlexandrov is correct and this is a type of licensing question that would be on-topic at Programmers.
x You might want to familiarize yourself with some basic C# concepts so you can rephrase your question in a way other programmers can understand. For example, a string is a reference type, so I&#39;m not sure what you mean when *you* say &quot;STRING Property can store a VALUE TYPE&quot; because I don&#39;t think you mean what most programmers would understand a *value type* to be.
x A small suggestion: you might want to code in english. It makes it easier to understand for most of the programmers on earth (= on stackoverflow) and it&#39;s a bit less knullig :D
x @MANOJ, in other words, don&#39;t forget about basic programming when using Angular. :) What is there to post as answer?I suggest you delete this question as it has little to do with Angular and is unlikely to benefit future Angular programmers.
x Why is this question closed??  .NET programmers shouldn&#39;t be allowed to know why their app crashed to the desktop with no diagnostic?
x Stack Overflow is a Question and Answer site for programmers, not a  code-writing service, you need a freelance programmer for that. As it stands that makes your question off-topic for this site as it&#39;s not about a specific programming problem. However if you make an attempt at this yourself and run into problems feel free to ask about them here.
x @GrijeshChauhan: Actually I believe adding such information does more harm than good, because too many programmers do not understand the implications of relying on unspecified / implementation-defined behaviour, and happily use whatever &quot;works for me&quot;, then wonder why the next compiler or OS update breaks their code.
x Welcome to SO. This logic you describe is definitely possible. However we are not a code writing service more a community that helps programmers and programming enthusiasts. Do you have something you started you need help with?
x @MadProgrammer again, I&#39;m not disagreeing with you. If you want someone to understand a problem, simply telling them &quot;this is how you _should_ do it&quot; and not providing the full background does them no good. We keep the answers to questions on SO relevant to the question being asked, and we see lots of questions that have very simple answers to professional programmers. So, when we answer questions, we do so, _in the best possible way_ to solve the problem at hand, and leave the _it could be done better_ to the asker to figure out.
x @SurenderThakran it shows that the candidate understands JavaScript functions at a deeper level than its similarities to other programming languages. If they don&#39;t know how to use arguments or how to invoke functions with more control then it suggests they may be a JS novice (no matter how capable they are at programming in general). This question is specifically asking for good strategies to interview advanced JS programmers, so this sort of question is very appropriate (there are at least a few dozen other good ways to test for this, too)

x @SlowCoder74: this has not much to do with C# specifically. Over the years programmers have discovered insights in how to implement concepts in OO-programming languages. A nice result is the *Design Patterns* book of the *Gang of Four*.
x `NullReferenceException` is a common situation for beginner programmers. The link provided should help you understand the problem. Then use the debugger to find what/where/when you have a variable that is `null`.
x Using your code and native code, I was unable to reproduce your error. I hit both the Windows key, and the context menu key, to no avail. This was tested in Chrome, what browser are you using? Are you certain that what you think is happening is actually happening?
x I&#39;ll repeat myself, Stack Overflow is not a free code-writing service. It is a Question and Answer site for professional and enthusiast programmers. You&#39;ve asked your &#39;question&#39; without even taking the site tour which should have popped up when you registered your account and then have the nerve to demand that I provide you with a working solution, which would take up my time at no profit to me besides imaginary internet points. Please take the site tour, make an attempt at solving the problem yourself and then post a new question if you encounter problems.
x Maybe not in terms of LOC, but in writing-time context. While using external files(xml for example) you have to open this file, write down the class name, and xml tags. So you are losing focus on programming and start brainless creating of config. While using annotations i stay in same file, just write one additional line of annotation. So I don&#39;t have to search for proper config file, copy existing entry and modify it to new repository.  \nSomeone wrote words of wisdom - Programmers are lazy guys.
x @bluefog - &quot;Too broad&quot; is &quot;too broad&quot;, regardless of the SE technology sites.  One problem with referring new users to other sites is that they almost never read the site guidance before re-posting their question.  Programmers sees a lot of whack-the-troublesome, un-researched, rough, &quot;design&quot; questions that are copy-pasta&#39;d from site to site based upon otherwise well intentioned referrals.
x Well once you&#39;ve added a value, you never &quot;un-add&quot; it. Your code always starts off by checking to see what the *previous* total was. I think if you just forget about &quot;Amount&quot; it&#39;ll work a lot better.

x @juanchopanza: I believe we&#39;ve come full circle to my point above... *&quot; somewhat application/library-domain specific, and the best fit for one community of programmers may not suit another. It&#39;s not worth arguing about.&quot;*.  FWIW, I upvoted this answer before my first comment and think it&#39;s a perfectly fine alternative, I&#39;m just saying that the `**` option is not inherently/consistently incorrect or inferior.
x @gnat I agree. I was merely suggesting to the OP that this question is clearly off topic for SO. Asking questions about development methodologies is on topic for Programmers SE. A reworded form with more effort will be better suited there.

x hahaha, nnnnnnn, said it right...foolish people.  This is what open source produces, horrible un-informed &quot;programmers&quot;.  Seriously, thanks to open source you have hackers, not programmers shaping the web.  Such a shame.
x it is not that big, but I can shrink it a bit... I put it that way because it is kind of the program as whole that should work better :).
x @AlexanderO&#39;Mara I&#39;m sorry, but the about in Stackoverflow has this &quot;Q&amp;A for professional and enthusiast programmers&quot;. And since this is someone related with stackoverflow&#39;s about, I thought I could ask from you guys. Anyways, can you answer the question?
x This question doesn&#39;t deserve the downvotes. Though it&#39;s trivial to PHP/Java/C programmers, it may be confusing to people coming from other languages, which do allow minus signs in identifiers. E.g. the Scheme language. Or CSS.
x As an aside, the MS implementation is non-conforming. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/372980/do-you-use-the-tr-24731-safe-functions
x Why not just load the data and then carry on as normal? Show us what you tried or where specific you need help.
x @Marko As a matter of fact it is. I am sure a majority of the applications are running on Java 6 and 7. Java 8 is a major step ahead in the way we Java programmers write code.
x @PalDev Yes you are right. Those programmers in Facebook are really genius!
x What? No pleasantries? Just farming out your homework to the heartless masses of stackoverflow programmers? Some of us like to be wined and dined before we&#39;re exploited you know.
x I don&#39;t think Stack Overflow is the right place to ask this kind of question. Stack Overflow is meant to help programmers solve problems. You are trying to install something that doesn&#39;t happen to work out for you, but you haven&#39;t really pin down the problem to a question that people over here can easily help you with. Most people wouldn&#39;t want to dive into the software you are trying to install and then try to figure out why it doesn&#39;t work for you. If you can make the question more specific, you&#39;ll likely get better help.
x But you have to replicate the undefined thing in every file; of which organized code should have several to differentiate functionality. Generally, I want to find null as well as undefined; it&#39;s not very frequent that the difference between the two will help any programmers at all.
x @iharob C++ programmers are only less skilled (whatever that means) because to write C++ you don&#39;t have to go as low-level as you must in C. But you definitely can go if you want. Many programmers just don&#39;t need to go that low. A C++ programmer can definitely know how to use `memcpy` and `realloc`.
x This is my opinion, but you should learn c, if you go learn c++ first, then you will never need to understand pointers and how to work directly with memory, for instance if you learn the `std::string` class then you will never understand how is a string really represented in memory, usually c++ only programmers are less skilled, for what I know.
x Though you can be forgiven for not realising it, this is a huge question. Web frameworks often minify and concatenate all CSS and serve it as one huge file, which can be fetched on first arriving on the site and then cached forever until changed. This requires including version numbers in your CSS URLs to allow you to manually tell the browser when it needs to fetch a new CSS file. However, the one-huge-file approach is not the only one, and there are tradeoffs to be made between minimising requests and minimising wasted data transfer.
x I say all that not to be mean, but to tell you one of the most important things I know about programming: **the compiler is your best teacher**. Write small programs, and make sure they _build_ and _run_, then make them bigger. I&#39;ve been a professional programmer for over twenty years, and I still do this everyday ... if you were to add the word _test_ to the _build_ and _run_ advice, this would be one of my number one things that I tell beginning programmers.
x Between you and @DanielRoseman, I am now convinced not to change the names. I&#39;m writing [a tutorial](https://aliteralmind.wordpress.com/2015/02/13/django_auth_tutorial_7/) on how to implement the reset-your-password feature (as a tool to teach myself), and I don&#39;t want to teach something that&#39;s unacceptable to established Django programmers.
x Sounds like you want a lot but can&#39;t program anything. Have you thought of hiring programmers?
x @Mohit Bhasi I tried visitor pattern but I&#39;m not sure its the situation here, since the other programmers will not have access to the code
x Yes, well, that&#39;s what you get when you&#39;re asking on a site mainly inhabited by programmers......................
x Extending the prototypes of built-in objects like this is a bad idea. If browsers start providing `Array.prototype.min` themselves in future with a behaviour that subtly differs from yours, future programmers working on your code - or any libraries your code co-exists with that try to use the native implementation - are going to be deeply confused by why they don&#39;t get the specified and documented behaviour when they call those methods.
x Unfortunately there is no Linux support, a serious drawback for many of us programmers.
x @Jiminion The only problem with returning a pointer that I see is that it&#39;s too easy to omit the assignment, especially for programmers new to your library. It is a problem because the compiler is not going to catch it, and there would be no immediate consequences in most cases, i.e. unless the initial element of the list is removed.
x SO is for programmers&#39; errors / help. We don&#39;t do questionnaires.
x Frankly, the `#define wipe() system(COMMAND)` is a terrible practice. All you&#39;re doing is concealing a well known function behind a new name. It just obfuscates the code for future programmers, especially since you don&#39;t make it clear `wipe` is a macro by using uppercase.
x I can provide the whole code that I have if that will help?
x thanks  gerrytan, but i don&#39;t understand what do you mean ? in my web.xml file i find &lt;servlet-class&gt;controller.Test&lt;/servlet-class&gt; and i replaced it in the post request but same error
x `AB` is a hex number, normally written by C programmers as `0xAB`. The hex number `A` has bit pattern `1010`, and `B` is `1011`, so together they are `10101011`. If you separate the different items in that bit pattern, you have `1 010 10 1 1` in binary, which is `1 2 2 1 1` in decimal.
x @cmaster For a library, it&#39;s not necessarily to give *all* header files to library users. Hence, you could for example publish `X.h` but choose not to publish `Ximpl.h`. For development purposes, you can keep `X.h` in some common public header folder (structure), and `Ximpl.h` closer to the source files. Within a project, I don&#39;t see how putting something in a source file helps protecting it, as opposed to putting it in a header file. Both can be modified by programmers with sufficient access rights.
x This is the best answer in the world for anything ever. I hope that one day when my kids grow up I can show them this answer and they can be impressed as much as I am right now. Generations of programmers are better because of it, you probably single handedly saved millions of lives here - well done sir, well done. Have a +1.
x @dyp Yes, I understand the effect of the dependency reduction. The protection of the class implementation is achieved by never handing the implementation class&#39; definition to a user of the code. He can&#39;t mess around with data members he doesn&#39;t know that they exist. Of course, this protection is only of real importance when the class is part of a library. Within a project, a `private` should be enough to keep programmers of other classes away from it (and if it&#39;s not, you should keep the programmers away from your code).

x Is the error message the same as before? I don&#39;t have much experience on triggers, because it is not recommended to use them for many reasons - so in case you have a choice to use it or not, i would recommend to solve this without a trigger

x It really isn&#39;t. `refs` is in `strict` for a reason. It&#39;s because it&#39;s a really good way to create brittle, dangerous and unmaintainable code that&#39;ll cause future sysadmins and maintenance programmers to hunt you down.
x @look__out Stackoverflow&#39;s goal is to create an archive of question and answer information for programmers.  Consequently it is bad form to repeatedly make major changes to the question   With every change, the existing answers no longer useful.  A reader might not even know why the answers are written.
x @malcolmhall the (0,0) coordinate is actually a valid coordinate. Saying it is invalid might mislead some developers. However, it usually comes about as a result of some error resulting in the (0,0) coordinate. For example [anNSNumber floatValue] will return 0 if the instance is nil. But because there is nothing of interest at (0,0) most programmers are willing to mark it as invalid to identify these errors.
x Stack Overflow is a forum for programmers with programming related questions. Your question would be more appropriate with some code (something along the lines of your `click` event explanation). If I were you, I&#39;d do it before I get down voted and having this thread closed.
x I talk to clients,  who understand &quot;encryption&quot;,  not &quot;hash&quot;.\nI have yet to encounter a programmer who doesn&#39;t understand one-way encryption vs hash.\nIn fact,  most programmers that I discuss encryption with,  know by context, if we&#39;re discussing uni-directional or bi-directional encryption.\n\nYou mention &quot;useful and correct&quot; information....let me point something out to you...\n\nExperience in cryptology will tell you that there is no such thing as a one way cipher.\n\nAny cipher,  one way or not,  can, and will be eventually cracked...making your one way encryption,  decryptable.
x If it is a bug, it&#39;s a subtle one; to notice it you have to be testing that something *doesn&#39;t* work - that you do in fact get an error when you attempt to open a process you shouldn&#39;t have access to. Programmers mostly test that stuff *does* work.  (I think they call that a negative feature.)  It wouldn&#39;t surprise me too much if it had gone unnoticed, particularly if it only occurs under rare circumstances.
x Setting default_socket_timeout via the ini, unfortunately, affects all outgoing connections, even DB sockets. Check out the solution I just posted, which extends SoapClient and overrides its __doRequest() method in order to allow setting the socket timeout for a single SoapClient.
x Thanks for the feedback. Your question style actually suggested that you might need some help on this level, and I think this is a good example of why inexperienced programmers need not to be frightened to ask on StackOverflow. However, you really should combine both answers here :-), because @garnaat&#39;s answer tells you how to use boto in this case.
x @Harald Those are the kind of things I want to avoid... I have seen in production that when a user clicks a button.... Nothing happens! It is because the code is just ignoring the unchecked exception... I don&#39;t see how this is a good thing? Sure people will say get better programmers... But no great programmer is perfect. Also, thank you for the URL. Good stuff!
x yep that does work, for &#39;equals&#39; (and which I put in my example)! cheers chancea! but my example was too easy... I haven&#39;t been able to get this to work for &#39;not equal&#39;... any ideas?
x In addition to what you&#39;ll learn from the answers, also learn that formatting and coding conventions are very important for communication with your fellow programmers (including those reading your code in the future). Class names should begin with a capital letter, and the code blocks should be properly indented.
x Yeah I was just trying to help the guy out. From what I understand stack overflow is for errors in code that a person needs help with. Programmers is more for talking about implementation or the finer points of code. I am new here though. XD
x that is not going to work
x Because .NET promises to work on *many* Windows versions.  And the &quot;Explorer&quot; visual style was meant for, you know, Explorer.  It isn&#39;t even the same control, the one that Explorer uses is a DirectUIHWND.  A secret one it doesn&#39;t share with us.\n\nMicrosoft doesn&#39;t promise that the visual style is going to be available on future versions.  The style is undocumented, programmers discovered it by reverse-engineering.  Yes, works today, no guarantees for tomorrow.  Not the kind of risk the .NET Framework programmers ever take.
x I&#39;m not completely certain, but this might be better suited to the programmers stack exchange. This SE is more for specific programming (code) problems and questions.
x @Enigmativity The function works as expected however, I don&#39;t think its possible to use it in a switch-case since each case requires a constant value. Either way that problem is out of scope from my original question. Thanks though :)
x You have the choice but there a lot of programmers who like to avoid member if not needed and to have operator like == as external free friend functions. I think it&#39;s also the case of the standard library implementations.
x Are you sure you are the right person to advice the programmers? (Since you have to ask for help here, it&#39;s obviously not your area...)
x Because there are people that get confused with a functional language approach; it&#39;s outside of many programmers&#39; comfort zones. Remember that you should code in a way that eases future maintenance efforts and clever approaches like this may hinder understanding where the simple loop and concatenate may not.
x And do you use faces-config.xml ?
x when you remove the end slash, do you get url not found error?
x Sublime Text 2 with package additions work well. Our company develops everything in CF, the programmers here seem to like it well. We have moved off of Dreamweaver and Eclipse. Notepadd++ also has some ok plugins.
x Guys, please don&#39;t rate questions down due to 1) Lack of knowledge/experience, or 2) Lack of prior research.\n\nS.O. is a resource for many programmers of all skill levels to learn, let&#39;s not discourage new users by rating down their questions unless it&#39;s apparent there was no effort put in to solve the problem.
x Yeah it is something that can easily bite newcomers as well as experienced programmers. Therefore it is better to avoid such issues. I just thought of another issue when using an array. You did not initialise `word` via e.g. `char word[20] = {&#39;\0&#39;};` therefore its value is undefined. If you are on linux press `CTRL+D` when entering a word. This results in `EOF` and `std::cin` not reading in anything and keeping `word` unchanged. Now even though you did not read anything in you will most still likely enter the while-loop. `std::string` combined with an `std::string::empty` check avoids this.
x @Brandon, well it&#39;s specific about `stackexchange` example. On `meta` there are site programmers that could shed some light on the way it&#39;s build. And if he used &quot;*other sort of &quot;tag cloud&quot;*&quot; this post will also be closed down.
x May be a Repeater can do, but i dont think it is a best solution. I need to check.
x May be a Repeater can do, but i dont think it is a best solution. I need to check.
x This post might answer the question but a little more explanation will help out fellow programmers how it works.
x It seems that diligent, conscientious programmers - the type that may end up making a framework like Zend or Pear, prefer spaces for the above mentioned reasons. All the lazy programmers I know prefer tabs. Also, sometimes there is alignment between different parts of the line (not just the left-most non white-space character) which gets messed up when tabs are used. So personally I avoid them
x Looks much better. And as bounds checking goes, this is C++. We trust other programmers ;)
x When people overly compliment female programmers...This is the exact reason we have so few...
x @SiKing - I did it was where I learned about XmlHolder etc. But I wanted to know if there is a way to do this without using a script. The people who will maintain this is not programmers. And to expect them to understand how to write it is not fair to them. But thanks hey - it is worth reading..
x Swing and a miss...... What I meant was why does being able to decompile this particular class, make other programmers lives easier? To answer myself, it really doesn&#39;t, hence why your question is being downvoted into oblivion. If this was an attempt to gain rep, you clearly haven&#39;t read anything of the help section.

To answer myself, it really doesn&#39;t, hence why your question is being downvoted into oblivion. If this was an attempt to gain rep, you clearly haven&#39;t read anything of the help section.
x @GregBurghardt I doubt my employer would be happy with me posting their IP! But I&#39;ll have a look at the programmers to see if that&#39;s more appropriate. I can see quite a few questions about coding style on SO.
x I agree with you, however, in this case, the situation dictates it
x From that page: While writing an application, a programmer will recompile and test often, and so compilation must be fast. This is one reason most optimizations are deliberately avoided during the test/debugging phase. Also, program code is usually &quot;stepped through&quot; (see Program animation) using a symbolic debugger, and optimizing transformations, particularly those that reorder code, can make it difficult to relate the output code with the line numbers in the original source code. This can confuse both the debugging tools and the programmers using them.
x Basically, the people who monitor this thread are hard-core programmers and they expect a classic programming question -- e.g., sample code from the original poster of what they have tried, and an explanation of what they expect to happen (but which is not happening).  It used to be the situation where general questions were just referred to superuser (where the O.P. ends up answering those questions themselves most of the time), but now the beta Emacs exchange has proven to be extremely useful for both kinds of questions -- i.e., difficult programming questions, *plus* other questions.
x I certainly have searched the web. (I have spent many hours doing so; That&#39;s where I found all the links referenced in my post.)  I believe that you have misunderstood my question, so I have edited the post to make it clearer. The question about AutoCompleteMode is not really relevant because my code (just like the code by Physicu$) does not utilize the AutoComplete functionality of the ComboBox itself, but creates its own implementation using a member ListBox. This is necessary because the built-in functionality of the ComboBox does not support substring based suggestions.
x Why do so many programmers not check the return values of the functions they use? they return a value because it&#39;s useful, don&#39;t you think? Apart from that, this does not answer the question, it just suggest an alternate method, but it doesn&#39;t explain why the code failed.
x @LakatosGyula - I think it might be (just you).  Proficient Java programmers have no problems reading `&quot;&quot;` ... and *most* would probably object loudly about use of `EMPTY` except in specific situations where `EMPTY` has a domain specific meaning.  (And in such cases, there is probably a more appropriate name.)
x @Barry I would make an API to make this decision explicitly - say, accept a boolean flag that says &quot;don&#39;t make a copy&quot; (or &quot;do make a copy, it does not matter) and default that flag to something. Let programmers decide what to do, rather than attempting to guess their intentions programmatically.
x @AngeloDM: My guess is because your question is admittedly something that beginner programmers learn; don&#39;t give two things the same name. You specifically asked for a mention in the standard, so I answered with that, but the idea is that I shouldn&#39;t have needed to.
x If I were designing a language, I would allow floating-point literals to include a suffix indicating what degree of precision was expected.  If an `pf` suffix indicates &quot;precise float&quot;, then the value `1111111.1xf` would be rejected, but `111111.125xf` would be accepted.  Sometimes a programmer intends for a compiler to use the closest representable value to some number, and sometimes a programmer intends a compiler to use an exact number and would want to know if it can&#39;t.  I wish languages would let programmers indicate such intentions.
x `url: &#39;hotels/hotelSortBy.php&#39;,`
x There&#39;s the String API. Programmers don&#39;t write documentation for nothing. So I suggest you take a look at it.
x This is a programmers forum, try ServerFault or SuperUSer
x I definitely think it would be a useful feature, though - it will just require a bit more time and effort, and would certainly need to be vetted by more knowledgeable C++ programmers than myself.
x @talemyn Because ternary statements let other programmers know you&#39;re a BOSS... despite the fact that as your comment pointed out, it is pretty easy to mix up the conditions
x We use the Rational Team Concert extension to Eclipse, so it all gets sync&#39;d to the repository. Since we&#39;ve got so many programmers sharing projects, the standardized system is to ensure collisions don&#39;t happen.
x That&#39;s only part of my code. I didn&#39;t want to post the whole page because the problem seems to lie with just the portion that calls the db.
x I thought that one of the benefits of TDD is to get a taste of how programmers would be writing code that uses your interface-under-test so as to catch omissions in the interface.  For example, if you are developing a map, it might not initially occur to you that you need to provide a method to enumerate all elements in the map, but while writing the tests (and before you have written any map code) you will inevitably realize that you need to be able to enumerate the elements in order to figure out whether the map actually contains the test elements that you are adding to it.
x Its not for experienced programmers, its easy to implement and use. :)
x Senior programmers can be the worst at being able to write clearly.  They don&#39;t want to write english, they want to write code...
x I knew there was a reason people hired programmers
x Because there are people that get confused with a functional language approach; it&#39;s outside of many programmers&#39; comfort zones. Remember that you should code in a way that eases future maintenance efforts and clever approaches like this may hinder understanding where the simple loop and concatenate may not.
x Awesome! Thanks for the swift reply. I can&#39;t believe I didn&#39;t even think of this. Sometimes as programmers we overlook the simplest of things. Thanks again :)
x @MimiPaul : The naming of your class isn&#39;t the real issue - my point was it&#39;s simply very confusing and if you ever work in a professional programming job, the other programmers wouldn&#39;t find it easy to follow your code. My main point was a `BroadcastReceiver` (or any other Android app component) will not be active until the user has started your app at least once. For later versions of Android you *MUST* have a MAIN / LAUNCHER app and the user *MUST* start it at least once. Also, if they ever &quot;Force Stop&quot; your app, the `BroadcastReceiver` will cease to work again.
x It&#39;s necessary to take note on an important issue, which would be valuable to &quot;future generations&quot; of programmers: in my project, let&#39;s call it project A, there&#39;s a reference to another project, let&#39;s call project B, through Maven. When I made changes in project B, I forgot to update .jar file through Maven Install, and then update Project A reference. This way, during Project A building, old table names stored in an outdated .jar were being the source of the problem.
x Sure, glad to be of help.  When you have a definite answer, please post your findings for the benefit of future generations of programmers.
x I thought the purpose of this site was if you&#39;re lost on something in programming and you need help from other programmers, you ask because maybe they have some kind of a solution. What you want me to do, ask something I don&#39;t need help with? I haven&#39;t received an answer, so i thought i&#39;d try again. Nothing wrong with that.
x `and use that IDE to keep track of refactoring`  Very few programmers use IDE&#39;s to &quot;keep track of refactoring&quot;.   Heck, I&#39;m not even sure what you mean by &quot;keep track of refactoring&quot; -- you make a change, you test the change.   Anyway, what about just using a good source control system like SVN or similar?
x Welcome to SO. You have _searched the net_ so if you could show us what you have that is not working and we can help you improve it. This could be a good question if the community has something to build from. As it stands this is not a good question which is why you are getting down votes. Also you are asking for a batch answer but tagged PowerShell which looks like you are just fishing for an answer. We are here to help programmers and programming enthusiasts. We are not a code writing service.
x @TheLostMind, Fields and methods and _objects_.   Or really, _variables_ and methods and objects; fields being just one of several different kinds of variable in Java.  A variable is not an object, and learning that seems to be one of the biggest conceptual hurdles that newbies face before they can become effective programmers.  I often say things like &quot;`foo` can be modified&quot; when what I really mean is, &quot;the object to which `foo` _refers_ can be modified,&quot; but that&#39;s lazy of me, and it&#39;s misleading.  I try not to do it in this forum where so many newbies abide.
x It is not clear what you are asking. Can you give a complete example, understandable by non-master-chess-player programmers?
x Programmers use Windbg when their program fails due to heap corruption.  They should never be surprised that, you know, it tells you that the heap is corrupted.
x @user3608262: no, I&#39;m telling you PL/SQL isn&#39;t not designed specifically to be picked up quickly by non-programmers. Sure you&#39;ll get a grip of it fast enough, mastering it will take a whole lot more time though, especially since that requires a lot of knowledge about the database itself. (I don&#39;t know TSQL.)
x @Eliran, you may want to go investigate the _other_ 6000-odd questions on `{big-o, complexity-theory, time-complexity, space-complexity}` to see if they need closing as well :-) While it may be a CS topic, that doesn&#39;t _necessarily_ mean it doesn&#39;t belong here as well. Complexity analysis of algorithms _is_ of concern to programmers, at least those that want to write efficient code.
x @JohnSonderson Compilers are not allowed to optimize out function calls. Think about it: what if the map is accessed concurrently, and there is a change done to the map between the two accesses? Compilers have no way of knowing it; programmers do. Hence, adding a reference manually is the only way to avoid the second function call.
x You know Sparky, I&#39;m not really all that interested in you telling me what you&#39;re NOT here for, I&#39;m more interested in you telling me how I can get help.  In other words, where can I find the PHP that will complete the task I&#39;ve explained here? I&#39;ll remind you that the vast majority of programming languages, such as PHP, AJAX, PERL, C, C++, Ruby, JavaScript, etc. are being used by people who are non-programmers, like you, for example.  The bottom line is, people &quot;borrow&quot; various programming to meet their needs.  Just like I&#39;m trying to do, Sparky.
x That is going to put in a `null` in to the result IEnumerable if there is no match.
x Any way to enforce that T and Bar are the same type?
x @David542 did you see my [answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/28618326/3208640) !??
x @LuisMendo : I added an example.
x Ha! Thats crazy!
x Please be aware, user (application) level timers are inaccurate. This is root cause of many issues where programmers did not pay attention.
x :-))) I agree with you somewhat. I&#39;ve migrated to Java then Scala after C++11. Actually C++ is now too complex and too broad for single language - this results &#39;several languages in one&#39;. But reality is - C programmers often learn C++ and (which makes the deal) then they return to C and become real programmers - after this they start to be language-agnostic. :-|
x @TobiasJohansson The shift is faster than division, but its compiler&#39;s job, not programmers, to make the substitution.
x Im on mac OS, I should have it installed (hopefully? Sorry im new to this)
x No, this is not a typical VS2013 problem, you&#39;re on your own.  When you have a problem that hundreds of thousand other programmers don&#39;t have then you suspect your machine first.  Try another one.  Or you can call Microsoft Support and they&#39;ll ask you to do otherwise unguessable things to arrive at a diagnostic.  Which might well be &quot;try another machine&quot; :)
x The `class Vehicle&lt;T extends Vehicle&lt;T&gt;&gt;` construct is a highly advanced and extremely rarely used construct implemented only by veteran programmers who usually try it for a while and then more often than not decide that it was a bad idea after all, and revert to something far simpler.
x +1 for &quot;IF NOT EXIST&quot; as a robust way for apps to ensure that tables exist without risk of disturbing extant database contents.  Programmers new to DBMS coding should take this to heart and also consider learning about &quot;migrations&quot; frameworks to ensure that their schema is maintained in sync with their code.
x Well @dk... I did check but I did not copy paste... Retyped here and hence typing mistake.  Anyways... Some good points  by you are probably genuine...  But do you want me to explain what promises are in an answer.  Also... Stackoverflow is a place for programmers to get help in problems... Biggest part of that would be helping them in understanding the mistake in their code... Not just how to fix it...  And neither by providing a functionally pure, idiomatic scala solution.
x @user3905353 - Just wanted to add a little more context to my previous comment.  SO is designed to help solve programming problems and build a library of answers to help solve them.  In this instance the problem you posted how to solve &quot;syntax error, unexpected tIVAR, expecting end-of-input&quot; is solved by adding the missing &quot;end&quot;statements.  Other novice programmers who search SO for similar problems will not be able to solve it by simply removing class and method definitions as this solution dictates.  This simply is not a real world solution to the problem you posted.
x negative one for missing the point. counting cycles keeps you on the way, when we oop-programmers writing two or three classes here?
x Although this was clearly done to save on keywords, the reuse of `void` in this fashion serves only to confuse. But all C programmers gotta stomach it, I suppose...
x i didn&#39;t get to run this on windows i switched to linux and used cpp instead of java and it works pretty well.
x I&#39;m confused as to why this is going to Programmers. It is a typical agile Scrum question. What am I missing?
x I have flagged for migration to Programmers, please wait for the migration to occur.
x RE: Xedni - No, it doesn&#39;t work. See my update above.
x Question on Stackoverflow usually contain:\n    a specific programming problem, or\n    a software algorithm, or\n    software tools commonly used by programmers; and is\n    a practical, answerable problem that is unique to software development \nThis question seems too open ended, and will not be easily answered.
x I position the widget slightly out of the frame, then using the top and left coordinate, and the arc &quot;calculations&quot; I move the widget along the arc, but as I said, the offset is not happening correctly

x I was just using Xcode for my test, the real example comes from Data Structures for Game Programmers by Ron Penton, so I&#39;m assuming you can get away with it in most instances. @SebastianRedl
x Thank You for Your answer. I think I have to rephrase my question:\nWhy does it behave like that? What is the intention of the programmers to make it behave like that?\n\nMy issue is that I made a lot of different diagrams with same-sized boxes to make the formatting consistent. Then I realized I didn&#39;t have enough space in one of them, but if I scaled all of them a bit smaller, but still comfortable to read.\n\nAccording to Your suggestion, I would have had to resize some hundred panels and the spaces between them, which would have been tedious and error-prone.
x *Can you give me a hint on how to do this?*  Small hint- You have to write a program (Programmers all around the world recommend this)
x That&#39;s correct, they are not available in C#.  Bit of history, the original classic VB6 had default instances, and they were **not included** in VB.Net 1.0 and 1.1 because Microsoft wanted to make VB.Net &quot;on par&quot; with C# in terms of correct OOP.  There was such an outcry from VB programmers making the transition to .Net, though, that they were brought back in VB.Net 2.0 and they&#39;ve stayed ever since.
x Actually if you wanna to put it this way then nodeAt(2) is O(2) .. nodeAt(3) is O(3) ..and so on.  You&#39;re thinking too much. As programmers we try to avoid thinking as much as possible.
x If you haven&#39;t heard of &quot;premature optimization&quot; then you might enjoy reading what Donald Knuth had to say on the matter. Here is a sample of his quotes:\n\n&quot;Premature optimization is the root of all evil (or at least most of it) in programming.&quot;\n\n&quot;Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered.&quot;
x @startoftext: That&#39;s not what I meant by copy/paste code.  By copy/paste code, I mean trying to cobble together a program by copy/pasting code snippets from the Internet.  *Real programmers actually write code that meets their specific needs!*
x Use some paranthesis.
x actually this is a technical question about a code bug so it is a fit for SO, not programmers.SE. Though there&#39;s more than a few good questions about LSP on programmers, this one being about a specific PHP implementation that seems to have bugs is more specific and better for SO I&#39;d say.
x It is not some &quot;random programmers&quot; who designed C. And such choices are somehow arbitrary. Even if we use + to denote addition, aliens&#39; math books are very likely to use some other symbol for the same addition.
x This is the correct answer. Programmers should not re-invent the wheel (unless there&#39;s a really good reason).
x Other server problems can cause the same error messages you suggeting testing above. Check out the solution I just posted. It explicitly tests for timeout rather than guessing based on ambiguous messages with multiple potential causes.

x No, to tell other programmers that&#39;s what the code is doing
x This is the correct answer. Programmers should not re-invent the wheel (unless there&#39;s a really good reason).
x That produces `CONCAT(&quot;text%&quot;)`, which is not concatenating two strings. Use `CONCAT(&quot;&#39;+edtBookTitle.Text+&#39;&quot;, &#39;%&#39;)` instead. And be careful, if `edtBookTitle.Text` already contains quoted in it, it will break the SQL.  Either use `QuotedStr()` or a parameterized query to account for that.
x ow that is a disadvantage for programmers that wanna use facebook, I go looking for include other social media and maybe with email invitations
x @BastiM  As virtual box is open source I imagine there are programmers here who know the code.  The question can be generalized to &quot;Why would a virtual machine software not recommend a certain amount of ram&quot;, VB is what I have so i dont know if it is true for all vm.  Does that clarify?  Im not asking how to use the software
x Your comment of &quot;Have fun speculating!&quot;is a key indicator that this question wouldn&#39;t be a good fit on Programmers.  It would likely be closed as &quot;Primarily opinion based.&quot;
x Thank You Stanley. I could do that but I want my code little neater fso that the future programmers wont get confused.. I was playing with interfaces but not able to get the right way to do it.

x Such demeaning responses. Last time I use this website, I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m not a full fledged programmer you have to start somewhere, and clearly this is not the website for it when I&#39;m getting sarcastic answers by snobby programmers. Thanks though.
x Both answers were very helpful, your groupings with the parentheses made it click. I don&#39;t like the fact that it is overloading without me knowing about it, it seems this will lead to programmers not knowing exactly what is going on. I will make sure to change my use of string literals.

x &quot;even? leave &#39;em!&quot; is The One True Way to round number ;0)
x ...to sign-extend `int` values which are shifted right, does the vagueness offer any benefit to anyone that would offset the cost of forcing programmers to write constructs like `(int)((n ^ 0x80000000u) &gt;&gt; 4)-0x8000000`?
x @Tom You&#39;re right, professional programmers would probably do it differently. For example, they would not limit it to `count_two_chars`, making it `countChars(String s, char... chars)`, letting their callers pass as many `char`s as they wish.
x I thought about this, but the problem is, when other programmers check out the project and compile, they will have to add the jar to their local repository; and they won&#39;t know to do so, so it won&#39;t compile.
x So, if we&#39;re on the `Team` page, should the parent `&lt;li&gt;` have a colour added, or a class-name? Don&#39;t give us &#39;options,&#39; explain what you want/need. And please, *please*, show us your best efforts or evidence that you know what you&#39;re talking about: this is a site for *professional and enthusiast programmers*, not a free code-writing service.
x Likely your example is for a different version of the tool or not compatible with the part you have chosen so you may want to contact the vendor for upgrades; of course if the idea itself is practical you can always rework things by hand using information from the data sheet/programmers manual, perhaps to modify an nrf51822 configuration.
x I agree Pattern matching is an important concept in Scala. I am just talking about mixing of multiple concepts making the code elegant, idiomatic but  cryptic to new programmers.
x Also, setting default_socket_timeout via the ini, unfortunately, affects all outgoing connections, even DB sockets. Again, contrast with the solution I just posted, which extends SoapClient and overrides its __doRequest() method in order to allow setting the socket timeout for a single SoapClient.
x Looks disturbingly simple, yeah.  We programmers are trained to search out the hidden huge complex procedure that drives the whole system and when it&#39;s not there it&#39;s kind of unnerving.
x you are unlikely to get a answer for this. Unfortunately, the value you want to include on the fax is not present above, you will need to look through the original plugin to find where the value is available and this requires a php programmer. If you google hire php programmers you should be able to find someone to do this for you
x A lot of the Office indexers return a value of type *object*, roughly equivalent to the .NET 1.x collection objects like ArrayList.  Which maps to __ComObject, the RCW for a COM interface.  It has no get_Range() method, only the strongly typed interface does.  Using Range invokes the late-bound property getter.  You&#39;d have to cast to WorkSheet to use get_Range().  Which is not uncommon, breaking up such a long statement is desirable and many programmers like the IntelliSense hints.
x @Spartacus It happens, even with experienced programmers. Now you can take that 60 minutes to draft a really great question :) Make sure to explain the actual problem you&#39;re trying to solve, e.g. &quot;I have a file that looks like &lt;sample input file&gt;. It is a CSV file where column 1 holds IDs and column 2 holds names. I need to find all the IDs where the name starts with &#39;J&#39;. I tried A, B, and C (&lt;actual code snippet&gt;), but they took more than 10 minutes to run on a 42 byte file. How can I do this more quickly?&quot; Make sure to include sample input and your expected output. Good luck!
x languages such as BASIC and FORTRAN  may not have bitwise operators (depending on the variant). It&#39;s common in those languages to do things, like encoding &#39;options&#39; to a function in decimal digits of an integer, which may seem bizarre to C programmers. And things like `a*sel + b*(1-sel)` instead of `sel ? a  : b`.
x It is a pity your answer is too complex - in the comments - for novice Android programmers :-(
x This would really be unlikely to work on programmers. @JNYRanger you should probably spend time on that site to learn it&#39;s scope before suggesting people post their questions there. This is very vague and broad and lacks any specific question so it likely wouldn&#39;t fit on any SE site at all. It would be closed if posted on Programmers.
x Anger management isn&#39;t programming either, though some programmers could benefit from it :)
x and spaghetti is food eaten by programmers, yet you don&#39;t see cooking questions here. you&#39;re not asking for programming help. you&#39;re asking for what boils down to systems administration/recovery, which is offtopic.
x .mdf files are Microsoft SQL Server Database files that are used for Programmers.
x SQL Injection continues to be a common form of vulnerability, too many &quot;programmers&quot; cut and paste from examples and don&#39;t fix them. Therefore my policy is that non-parametrised queries are never acceptable, even in the simplest of examples. The next break in might be your personal data.
x Semantically speaking, the table tag is meant for listing tabular data. **It is not optimized to build structure**. The lack of response to your question is due to the fact that most decent web programmers know and agree with the above statement and will be reluctant to help you find a fix/workaround for your issue even though it is technically achievable. In other words, you&#39;re doing it wrong. And **SO is about learning how to do it right**, not how to patch it so it works until next browser update.
x @LiuGuangxuan This seems to be an error in the original book too. It should probably read either &quot;1024&quot; or &quot;1024.0f&quot;. (Possibly, an ambitiuous proofreader thought &quot;hey, 1024.0 and 1024 are the same, so I&#39;ll remove the unnecessary &#39;.0&#39;. Stupid programmers, they know nothing about math.&quot;)
x People come on Stackoverflow because they need help getting some of their code to work. Experienced programmers gather together to look at your code and sometimes they can spot the problem immediately. Other times, they plug the code into their compiler, debug it and spend a little time on trying to figure out the problem. When you don&#39;t post any code though, it makes it real hard to spot the problem in your code or debug your code.
x Hi Chris, just wondering if you ever got it working with the getSignedUrl method (as the ideal). I know you accepted the answer from Amit but I want to solve the problem the same way you did just using getSignedUrl and when there is only public-read ACL (no public-write) then I just can&#39;t seem to get Amazon to accept the PUT.
x @bzak: The example and your code don&#39;t match, your code flips the bits.
x around 3gb. from windows to unix machine. I suspect it could be a unix vs windows line ending problems as I am trying to push &quot;sync&quot; from perforce to svn.
x This is more about computer science theory and asymptotic analysis. It&#39;s more appropriate for Programmers SE.

x Thanks for all the input.   What I hear J an David saying is &quot;Just be careful and write the code right the first time.&quot;  Maybe you guys are better programmers than me, but I don&#39;t like walking a tightrope without a net. I make mistakes. And I like to catch them before ship my code.
x Well, not only will the HTML editors complain, but browsers will render it in unexpected ways. OP wants to know why, and I&#39;m generally happier working with programmers who ask why instead of blindly going &quot;you just can&#39;t, ok?&quot;
x Then why not? It&#39;s better explaining why instead of just saying it&#39;s not going to work, as I don&#39;t know anything about DevExpress. ;)
x `Is there a way I can change the default behaviour?` is a terrible idea.  Anyone who uses your assembly or new programmers will have no idea why a method that has always worked one way, now works another way.  Instead write your own extension method `ToScientificFloat()` and/or `ToScientificInt()`.  Now when people see this method, they instantly know it&#39;s doing something that is not default behavior.
x @TroelsJohannesen You also didn&#39;t make it clear whether you&#39;re attempting that ajax inside `myFunction()` or what, but I suppose that is where it should be.
x @ScottHunter *list*  is **not** the primary data structure in Prolog. Just a type of compound term that is often misused and abused, specially by novice programmers.
x @TroelsJohannesen You also didn&#39;t make it clear whether you&#39;re attempting that ajax inside `myFunction()` or what, but I suppose that is where it should be.
x If someone is incapable of understanding some code I wrote because it was unexpected, I would prefer they stop coding. More relevant is whether or not it is a good idea to begin with despite what other developers might expect. If it is a good idea, good developers will be capable of comprehending, appreciating, and even adopting it. Now I&#39;m not promoting the code in the original question, but I personally do something that shares a lot in common with it, and it does not conform to what most programmers expect or promote as good practice. But I don&#39;t care, because it is awesome.
x that is a very good point, I will try changing this. because as I said when opening all files at first the program took more time doing it than actually converting. I will do some changes and give feedback, thanks!
x @luk32: Yes, we can do all sort of inadvisable things as programmers. That is why in part SO exists...to help its users distinguish between good and bad practices. Just because something is *possible*, doesn&#39;t mean it is a *good idea*.
x I would recommend you didnt changed screens during the touchdown event. Instead raise a flag and change the screen at the end of the render event.
x Which again makes it clear how useless `__del__` is. For instance, if I where to use objects of a mutex guard class, I couldn&#39;t do the unlocking in the guard class&#39;s `__del__` method, because it&#39;s not enough to know that `__del__` will get called when ever the GC feels like doing its job ... I need the mutex released right when the guard object &quot;goes out of scope&quot; (I know that&#39;s stretching it, given Python&#39;s scoping rules).\nIMO `__del__` gives programmers the false impression that RAII in Python is doable via destructors when it really isn&#39;t. You have to use context managers for that.
