2 @EugeneMayevski'EldoSCorp If it's not about programming then why direct someone to Programmers?  License questions are allowed at programmers but this question wouldn't fit there either.

0 This would be hard even if you had programming skills. How about setting a password instead, so only trusted people can work with it?

2 actually this is a technical question about a code bug so it is a fit for SO, not programmers.SE.

2 @GladstoneKeep - This question wouldn't be a good fit on Programmers either.  In essence, it's a toolset implementation question ("How do I make Foo do blah?") which is off-topic on Progs.

0 :-))) I agree with you somewhat. I've migrated to Java then Scala after C++11. Actually C++ is now too complex and too broad for single language - this results 'several languages in one'. But reality is - C programmers often learn C++ and (which makes the deal) then they return to C and become real programmers - after this they start to be language-agnostic. :-|  Roman Nikitchenko 1 min ago

0 Stack Overflow is a Question and Answer site for programmers, not a  code-writing service, you need a freelance programmer for that.

0 @Akarienta This is true, but it doesn't help when someone simply doesn't know the functions to use yet. This could have been a two word solution of concatMap show, it's simply learning the API. The actual problem solved here was learning about previously unknown functions in Prelude. It's not that OP needed to adapt a more complex problem to fit his needs, it's merely ignorance of an existing solution. Yes, programmers need to learn how to read documentation and follow similar problems, but I'm going to wager that you didn't know about concatMap when you first started using Haskell.  bheklilr 10 secs ago

0 For some of us that computer science class was a long time ago (like 35 years) and we haven't used terminology like l_i such that j, P[j]= T [i+j-1] + l_i since then. Could you, perhaps, rephrase your question in English?

0 Yes, we regularly run into the situation on our development server, we usually have many programmers accessing the same DB for development purposes. So if I add new columns to a table and update a sproc to use them, I make the new parameters all optional, so I don't break the app for other developers who aren't running my new code yet. As long as you're just adding and not deleting or restructuring, that can work fine.

You can call it nitpicky if you want, but if you're going to communicate with other programmers and ask for your help, you need to learn to communicate properly. That means giving a complete question, showing what you're starting with, showing what you've tried, and explaining how the things you've tried don't work.  mason 7 secs ago

0 @VikasVerma Why are arrays not like objects? Because of history. When Java was designed, most attempts at language innovation failed when not similar to C in syntax and style. Thus C++, Objective-C, and Java were among the few languages to survive obscurity during that era. Java was consciously designed to include curly braces, primitive, and plain arrays to be familiar to mainstream programmers of the day. See interviews with James Gosling and other Sun folks. Some people stick with Collections rather than arrays for pure OOP.  Basil Bourque 11 secs ago

0 Kritner, per the help center, this is a legitimate SO question (though perhaps not a good one): Stack Overflow is for professional and enthusiast programmers, people who write code because they love it. We feel the best Stack Overflow questions have a bit of source code in them, but if your question generally covers      a specific programming problem, or     a software algorithm, or     software tools commonly used by programmers; and is     a practical, answerable problem that is unique to software development   then youre in the right place to ask your question!

0 You might want to familiarize yourself with some basic C# concepts so you can rephrase your question in a way other programmers can understand.

0 @MadProgrammer again, I'm not disagreeing with you. If you want someone to understand a problem, simply telling them "this is how you should do it" and not providing the full background does them no good. We keep the answers to questions on SO relevant to the question being asked, and we see lots of questions that have very simple answers to professional programmers. So, when we answer questions, we do so, in the best possible way to solve the problem at hand, and leave the it could be done better to the asker to figure out.  Ryan J 1 min ago
0 @SurenderThakran it shows that the candidate understands JavaScript functions at a deeper level than its similarities to other programming languages. If they don't know how to use arguments or how to invoke functions with more control then it suggests they may be a JS novice (no matter how capable they are at programming in general).

However, having no idea about when it's best to use a Task vs Thread, or when should I use a delegate, or any of those types of things makes learning impossible.  I can hack something together yes.  It will be the most willy nilly code that is awful to read, have no real design flow, but will work.  Am I to understand that is how you all code as well?

0 Maybe not in terms of LOC, but in writing-time context. While using external files(xml for example) you have to open this file, write down the class name, and xml tags.

So I don't have to search for proper config file, copy existing entry and modify it to new repository.   Someone wrote words of wisdom - Programmers are lazy guys.  Warzyw 1 min ago

0 @iharob C++ programmers are only less skilled (whatever that means) because to write C++ you don't have to go as low-level as you must in C. But you definitely can go if you want.

0 This is my opinion, but you should learn c, if you go learn c++ first, then you will never need to understand pointers and how to work directly with memory, for instance if you learn the std::string class then you will never understand how is a string really represented in memory, usually c++ only programmers are less skilled, for what I know.  iharob 56 secs ago

0 @Lrrr I agree with what you said above. But questions like this can speed up learning by following paths that other programmers have treaded and found to be more useful than others. A case like this where we have to restrict ourselves from sharing our experiences and opinions undermines the capabilities of such a powerful community we have.  Meena Chaudhary 2 mins ago

0 AB is a hex number, normally written by C programmers as 0xAB. The hex number A has bit pattern 1010, and B is 1011, so together they are 10101011. If you separate the different items in that bit pattern, you have 1 010 10 1 1 in binary, which is 1 2 2 1 1 in decimal.  user3386109 1 min ago

0 @cmaster For a library, it's not necessarily to give all header files to library users. Hence, you could publish X.h but not Ximpl.h. For development purposes, you can keep X.h in some common header folder (structure), and Ximpl.h closer to the source files. Within a project, I don't see how putting something in a source file helps protecting it, as opposed to putting it in a header file. Both can be modified by programmers with sufficient access rights.  dyp 55 secs ago

0 This would be much better off on Statalist. There is no attempt at code here so it is not a good programming question for Stack Overflow. The advertised community here is professional and enthusiast programmers; it is not a forum to field any conceivable question about software use. Further, my guess is that the answer requires statistical thinking and you would reach a much wider audience in that respect on Statalist.

0 @dyp Yes, I understand the effect of the dependency reduction. The protection of the class implementation is achieved by never handing the implementation class' definition to a user of the code. He can't mess around with data members he doesn't know that they exist. Of course, this protection is only of real importance when the class is part of a library. Within a project, a private should be enough to keep programmers of other classes away from it (and if it's not, you should keep the programmers away from your code).  cmaster 39 secs ago

0 @malcolmhall the (0,0) coordinate is actually a valid coordinate. Saying it is invalid might mislead some developers. However, it usually comes about as a result of some error resulting in the (0,0) coordinate. For example [anNSNumber floatValue] will return 0 if the instance is nil. But because there is nothing of interest at (0,0) most programmers are willing to mark it as invalid to identify these errors.  pnizzle 1 min ago

You mention "useful and correct" information....let me point something out to you...  Experience in cryptology will tell you that there is no such thing as a one way cipher.

0 Programmers generally want to rewrite things from scratch.  That usually ends badly.   Whatever sins the old code contains, it presumably addresses an implicit set of requirements.  Rewrite the code doesn't make sense if you don't know the requirements, and without looking at the old code, it is pretty hard to guess that set. (Even looking at the old code it is hard to guess, but if  you repair it, you don't have to know the requirements as well; they're [by definition] already addressed.

0 Yeah it is something that can easily bite newcomers as well as experienced programmers. Therefore it is better to avoid such issues. I just thought of another issue when using an array. You did not initialise word via e.g. char word[20] = {'\0'}; therefore its value is undefined. If you are on linux press CTRL+D when entering a word. This results in EOF and std::cin not reading in anything and keeping word unchanged. Now even though you did not read anything in you will most still likely enter the while-loop. std::string combined with an std::string::empty check avoids this.  mat69 39 secs ago

0 From that page: While writing an application, a programmer will recompile and test often, and so compilation must be fast. This is one reason most optimizations are deliberately avoided during the test/debugging phase. Also, program code is usually "stepped through" (see Program animation) using a symbolic debugger, and optimizing transformations, particularly those that reorder code, can make it difficult to relate the output code with the line numbers in the original source code. This can confuse both the debugging tools and the programmers using them.  Steve 7 secs ago

If an pf suffix indicates "precise float", then the value 1111111.1xf would be rejected, but 111111.125xf would be accepted.

For example, if you are developing a map, it might not initially occur to you that you need to provide a method to enumerate all elements in the map, but while writing the tests (and before you have written any map code) you will inevitably realize that you need to be able to enumerate the elements in order to figure out whether the map actually contains the test elements that you are adding to it.

0 The class Vehicle<T extends Vehicle<T>> construct is a highly advanced and extremely rarely used construct implemented only by veteran programmers who usually try it for a while and then decide that it was a bad idea and revert to something far simpler.  Mike Nakis 58 secs ago
0 +1 for "IF NOT EXIST" as a robust way for apps to ensure that tables exist without risk of disturbing extant database contents.

0 @user3905353 - Just wanted to add a little more context to my previous comment.  SO is designed to help solve programming problems and build a library of answers to help solve them.  In this instance the problem you posted how to solve "syntax error, unexpected tIVAR, expecting end-of-input" is solved by adding the missing "end"statements.  Other novice programmers who search SO for similar problems will not be able to solve it by simply removing class and method definitions as this solution dictates.  This simply is not a real world solution to the problem you posted.  heading_to_tahiti 45 secs ago

My issue is that I made a lot of different diagrams with same-sized boxes to make the formatting consistent. Then I realized I didn't have enough space in one of them, but if I scaled all of them a bit smaller, but still comfortable to read.  According to Your suggestion, I would have had to resize some hundred panels and the spaces between them, which would have been tedious and error-prone.  user3240047 1 min ago

Bit of history, the original classic VB6 had default instances, and they were not included in VB.Net 1.0 and 1.1 because Microsoft wanted to make VB.Net "on par" with C# in terms of correct OOP.  There was such an outcry from VB programmers making the transition to .Net, though, that they were brought back in VB.Net 2.0 and they've stayed ever since.  Idle_Mind 23 secs ago

0 As stackoverflow has grown it's unfortunate that overmoderation has killed what are actually helpful questions.  This was not an unreasonable or overly general question, and it's one many programmers would reasonable ask and want a community answer on. Classifying this as too general may be a fun exercise of moderator power, but actions like that relegate stackoverflow to answering questions related to minutae rather than questions which are actually helpful.  I note that many of the most popular (and useful) questions on SO would be closed as too general by today's overzealous moderators.  tohster 1 min ago

0 A lot of the Office indexers return a value of type object, roughly equivalent to the .NET 1.x collection objects like ArrayList.  Which maps to __ComObject, the RCW for a COM interface.  It has no get_Range() method, only the strongly typed interface does.  Using Range invokes the late-bound property getter.  You'd have to cast to WorkSheet to use get_Range().  Which is not uncommon, breaking up such a long statement is desirable and many programmers like the IntelliSense hints.  Hans Passant 1 min ago

I tried A, B, and C (<actual code snippet>), but they took more than 10 minutes to run on a 42 byte file. How can I do this more quickly?" Make sure to include sample input and your expected output.

0 Note that it is a good idea to drop the inline from static inline: With static the compiler already knows that the given function is only ever used in the given translation unit and can make a better choice about inlining it than the programmer who adds the inline to the definition. Too much inlining hurts performance as much as too little inlining, and most programmers who add the inline keyword do not know or test whether inlining that function will indeed speed things up. Of course, if your tests(!) show that static inline is faster than static, go ahead and use it :-)  cmaster 2 mins ago

0 I really don't care to write code to be readable by developers that can't understand something they don't expect. More relevant is whether or not it is a good idea to begin with despite what other developers might expect. If it is a good idea, good developers will be capable of comprehending, appreciating, and even adopting it. Now I'm not promoting the code in the original question, but I personally do something that shares something in common with it, and it does not conform to what other programmers expect or promote as good practice.

0 Which again makes it clear how useless __del__ is. For instance, if I where to use objects of a mutex guard class, I couldn't do the unlocking in the guard class's __del__ method, because it's not enough to know that __del__ will get called when ever the GC feels like doing its job ... I need to mutex released right when the guard object "goes out of scope" (I know that's stretching it, given Python's scoping rules). IMO __del__ gives programmers the false impression that RAII in Python is doable via destructors when it really isn't. You have to use context managers for that.  antred 23 secs ago

0 @DanielA.White Are you sure?  I recall asking similar questions over there in the past and they pushed it back to Stack Overflow because it was about setting up a programmers environment.  Is there official policy on this?
0 @Akarienta This is true, but it doesn&#39;t help when someone simply doesn&#39;t know the functions to use yet. This could have been a two word solution of `concatMap show`, it&#39;s simply learning the API. The actual problem solved here was learning about previously unknown functions in Prelude. It&#39;s not that OP needed to adapt a more complex problem to fit his needs, it&#39;s merely ignorance of an existing solution. Yes, programmers need to learn how to read documentation and follow similar problems, but I&#39;m going to wager that you didn&#39;t know about `concatMap` when you first started using Haskell.
